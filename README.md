# AIHackathon

Home Page:
We have a home page which demonstrates the purpose and why we created this project.
It shows how we want to provide free financial planning to all, especially those in underpriveledged situations who might not be able to afford one.

Account Page:
This account page is used to create a profile for the user which has all the necessary input needed for financial planning and advisement.
A pie chart and line chart can also be displayed in order to show fiscal spending habits and future compound interest on money saved.

AI Bot Page:
This page lets you talk to our artifical intelligence bot. You can provide information about your spending and saving habits.
We are then able to descipher retirement goals and how much you should spend, save, and invest, through fiscal algorithms.

We want to make financial planning and education free for the common person!
